# Iris Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Project Overview

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the famous Iris dataset to understand the structure, patterns, and relationships between different flower features.
The aim is to practice data analysis, visualization, and extracting insights using Python.

This project is created as part of my **B.Tech Data Science learning journey (2nd Year)**.

## Dataset Information

The Iris dataset contains measurements of iris flowers from three different species:

* Setosa
* Versicolor
* Virginica

### Features in dataset:

* Sepal Length (cm)
* Sepal Width (cm)
* Petal Length (cm)
* Petal Width (cm)
* Species (Target Variable)

---

## Objectives

* Load and explore the dataset
* Handle basic data inspection
* Perform statistical analysis
* Visualize feature distributions
* Identify relationships between variables
* Compare species based on measurements

---

## Tools & Technologies Used

* Python 🐍
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Jupyter Notebook

---

## Steps Performed in EDA

1. Data Loading and Understanding
2. Checking dataset shape and info
3. Handling missing values
4. Statistical summary using describe()
5. Data visualization:

   * Histograms
   * Pairplots
   * Boxplots
   * Correlation heatmap
6. Observations and insights from plots

---

## Key Insights

* Setosa species is clearly separable based on petal length and width.
* Versicolor and Virginica show some overlap in sepal features.
* Petal features are more useful for classification than sepal features.
